        <p class="MidJourney">Midjourney is an independent research lab that produces an artificial intelligence program under the same name that creates images from textual descriptions and Stable Diffusion.
           It is speculated that the underlying technology is based on Stable Diffusion. The tool is currently in open beta, which it entered on July 12, 2022. pretty impresive if you ask me.
           <br>
            Users create artwork with Midjourney using Discord bot commands. This AI is amazing, its downsides are you only get a free trial (even though you can make alternative accounts) and it's only available in Discord for now.
          <br>
        The creators and staff of MidJourney say it will be available in a website once it's out of beta.
        here's some impressive art made by MidJourney.

        <p class="DALL·E"> DALL-E 2 is an image generation model developed by OpenAI that can generate high-quality images from textual input. 
          <br>
          Given a textual description as input, DALL-E 2 uses a combination of natural language processing and computer vision techniques to create a corresponding image. 
          The model can generate images of objects, scenes, and even abstract concepts that do not exist in the real world.
        
          DALL-E 2 works by mapping the input text to a set of image features, which are then used to generate the corresponding image. The model uses a transformer-based architecture, similar to the ones used in large language models like MidJourney. A great free alternative for MidJourney.

We don't have ads, we don't sell data. We currently have no plans to monetize. Why offer these tools for free? We operate two tech websites: Alphr & TechJunkie. We thought our users might find these tools helpful. For now, utilizing our existing infrastructure we are able to operate these tools at minimal additional cost. Building this and watching the growth has been fun, so we’re going to keep building free stuff.
